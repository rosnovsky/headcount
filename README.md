# Headcount

_working title_

Podcast analytics system

Headcount allows podcast produces to prepend their media URLs with an API path, and get all sorts of statistics and analytics about their audience.

System is in development and is in no way ready for production use. **None of the things below work at the time of this commit.**

# Installation

`npm install headcount`

# Use

`npm start`

Prepend all your media URLs with `https://yourserver/count/`, for example, if your media file is at `https://podtema.com/media/evergreen/evergreen070.mp3` and you've installed `Headcount` directly on your server, your new URL will be:

`https://podtema.com/count/media/evergreen/evergreen070.mp3`
